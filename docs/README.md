## The short version

The book's thesis is that colour is a lossy projection of an
infinite-dimensional signal onto three numbers, and that almost every practical
difficulty in the subject is a consequence of that compression.

The engine's commitment is that **nothing in the book is transcribed**: every
figure, matrix and number is computed here from published colorimetric data, and
the build fails if a citation points at nothing.
